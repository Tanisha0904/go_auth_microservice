Order,  Task,               Process Name,           What it does
1,      Environment Setup,  Config Initialization,  Create a .env file to store your JWT_SECRET. Never hardcode keys!
2,      Define Structures,  Modeling,               Create structs for LoginRequest and Claims. This ensures type safety.
3,      Token Creation,     Signing Logic,          Write the function that takes a User ID and returns a signed string.
4,      Login Endpoint,     Authentication,         Create a POST route. This is where you verify credentials against a DB (or mock).
5,      Build Middleware,   Authorization,          Write a function that checks for Bearer <token> in headers for protected routes.
6,      Router Setup,       Routing,                Use Gin to group routes into Public (Login/Signup) and Private (Dashboard).
7,      Server Startup,     Bootstrapping,          "In main.go, load .env, initialize routes, and start listening on a port (e.g., :8080)."


After addition of database
Order,  Task,               Why?
1,      Install Postgres,   You need a running instance (or a Docker container).
2,      Update Models,      Add gorm.Model to include CreatedAt and DeletedAt fields.
3,      Connect in Main,    Call database.Connect() inside main.go before routes start.
4,      Create Signup,      Write a SignupHandler to actually put data into the DB.
5,      Add Hashing,        Never store plain text passwords. Use the bcrypt library.
